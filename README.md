# learning-python
A record of exercises and progress

I am learning Python with the course "Introduction to Computer Science and Python Programming" from MITOpenCourseware while doing exercises from the 1MWTT Summer of Code program, and I think it's a good idea to track my progress using GitHub. Maybe someone out there will find it useful - who knows?
