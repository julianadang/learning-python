#   unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so)
#   and yells back: NO, NOT SINCE 1938! To make your program really believable, have Grandma shout a different
#   year each time, maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. You can’t stop talking to Grandma until you shout BYE.

#                                       Leap Years
#   Leap years. Write a program that asks for a starting year and an ending year and then puts all the leap years between
#   them (and including them, if they are also leap years). Leap years are years divisible by 4 (like 1984 and 2004). However,
#   years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and
#   2000, which were in fact leap years). What a mess!
